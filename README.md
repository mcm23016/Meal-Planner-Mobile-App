# Overview

This is a Meal Planner App. I had this idea since I am busy with school and find myself skipping meals frequently. I have always wanted to make a useful app, and I thought this would help me eat better.

The app is essentially a list of all the meals in a week. The user can then add meals into each day's meals. The user can add their own meals to the app, generate a basic grocery list from the meals planned for the next week, and clear the week's meals when they reach the end of the week.

If you want to run this project, just open a blank activity in Android Studio and copy the two included files into the project. The build.gradle.kts file is in gradle scripts and is for the module, and not the project.

# Development Environment

I used Android Studio to develop the app. ChatGPT helped me a lot since I did not know much about Kotlin.

I used Kotlin as my programming language.

# Useful Websites

* [Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/)
  : A really good source to learn Android Studio, Kotlin, and how to connect the UI to you code.
* [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)
  : Was very helpful in generating code and debugging.

# Future Work

There are a lot of things I think could be improved over time:
* Allow users to edit and delete recipies .
* UI Update (I am still learning how to make it look good).
  - Overall just make it look better
  - Add Icons for buttons
  - Add Settings for user to customize look
* Make it so the top day listed is the current day so that the user does not need to always scoll down.
* Add a sign-in feature so users can user multiple devices and share plans or recipies with other users.
* Allow the user to save photos with their recipies to either show the final product, or save instructions.
* Add a gallery type recipe book that users can pick public recipies from.
* Clean up code by seperating it into seperate files.
